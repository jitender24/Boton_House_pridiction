# Boston_House_pridiction
prediction done using gradient decent 

Gradient Descent - Boston Dataset
Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.
I'm using  Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data having 379 cases.
Done a prediction for the test datasets csv file given with boston_x_test having 127 cases using Gradient Descent algorithm 
I done the following  task:-
1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps  in getting better results.
